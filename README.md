# Course Registration

This is a Course Enrollment Project using React JS.

## Features :

- A particular Course will not be able to enroll for multiple time.
- Course Credit hour Restriction will be managed automatically.
- If the remaining credit hour is not enough for the course, the system will automatically tell you that how much more credit hour will you need by a toast.

## state management of this project :

### I used 'state' twice in my project and in both case I used it to set an array. One of them I used to store the courses which is coming from the json file by an 'effect' and another one I used to store the Enrolled courses when any of the courses is clicked. In every state, the courses are being stored in the array as an object.
